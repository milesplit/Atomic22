This project is in its early stages that I am currently just building out for our own apps. However, we decided to open source it so that others might benefit as well... and perhaps even contribute to it.

The main goal of the project is to maintain a simple, yet extendable codebase based on the CommonJS standard and an MVVM (Model, View, View-Model) design pattern. It encourages clean code that is separated logically.

I would assume other folders will be added for third party libraries, plugins, business logic, etc. So this is just intended to be a base.

Titanium's atomic number is 22, so that's the meaning of the name.

~~~~~

Example Use

~~~~~~

APP.JS

// Instantiate the framework
var A22 = require('lib/framework').App({
	name: 'Atomic22 Example App',
	settings: {
		FOO: { type:'string', defaultValue:'Bar' }
	}
});
// Open the first window
A22.open('welcome');

~~~~~~~

VIEW/WELCOME.JS

exports.View = function(Me, opts) {
  
  // Apply the default stylesheet
	Me.style('default');
	
  // Create a label with an ID and Class for styling and reference later
	Me.label({
		id:'lblTitle',
		className: 'heading',
		text: 'Hello World'
	});
	
};


~~~~~~~~

VIEWMODEL/WELCOME.JS


exports.ViewModel = function($) {

  // Add a click event to the label and then change the text
	$('#lblTitle').on('click', function() {
		this.text = 'Goodbye World';
	});
	
};

~~~~~~~

STYLE/DEFAULT.JS


exports.Stylesheet = function($) {

	// Set window background color
	$('window', {
		backgroundColor: '#ffffff'
	});
	
	// Define formatting for the heading class
	$('.heading', {
		backgroundColor: '#ff0000',
		color: '#ffffff',
		top: 0,
		left: 0,
		right: 0,
		height: '50%'
	});
	
}
